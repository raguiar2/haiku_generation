a bird came down the walk:
a cap of lead across the sky
a charm invests a face
a clock stopped—not the mantel’s;
a death-blow is a life-blow to some
a deed knocks first at thought,
a dew sufficed itself
a door just opened on a street—
a drop fell on the apple tree
a face devoid of love or grace,
a lady red upon the hill
a light exists in spring
a little madness in the spring
a little over jordan,
a little overflowing word
a little road not made of man,
a long, long sleep, a famous sleep
a modest lot, a fame petite,
a murmur in the trees to note,
a narrow fellow in the grass
a poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
a precious, mouldering pleasure ’t is
a prompt, executive bird is the jay,
a route of evanescence
a sepal, petal, and a thorn
a shady friend for torrid days
a sickness of this world it most occasions
a sloop of amber slips away
a solemn thing it was, i said,
a something in a summer’s day,
a spider sewed at night
a thought went up my mind to-day
a throe upon the features
a toad can die of light!
a train went through a burial gate,
a triumph may be of several kinds.
a word is dead
a wounded deer leaps highest,
adrift! a little boat adrift!
adventure most unto itself
afraid? of whom am i afraid?
after a hundred years
ah, teneriffe!
all circumstances are the frame
all i may, if small,
all overgrown by cunning moss,

ambition cannot find him,
ample make this bed.
an altered look about the hills;
an awful tempest mashed the air,
an everywhere of silver,
angels in the early morning
apparently with no surprise
arcturus is his other name,—
are friends delight or pain?
as by the dead we love to sit,
as children bid the guest good-night,
as far from pity as complaint,
as if some little arctic flower,
as imperceptibly as grief
ashes denote that fire was;
at half-past three a single bird
at last to be identified!
at least to pray is left, is left.
beauty crowds me till i die,
because i could not stop for death,
before i got my eye put out,
before the ice is in the pools,
before you thought of spring,
belshazzar had a letter,—
bereaved of all, i went abroad,
besides the autumn poets sing,
blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
bless god, he went as soldiers,
bloom upon the mountain, stated,
bring me the sunset in a cup,
candor, my tepid friend,
come slowly, eden!
could i but ride indefinite,
could mortal lip divine
crisis is sweet and, set of heart
dare you see a soul at the white heat?
dear march, come in!
death is a dialogue between
death is like the insect
death sets a thing significant
delayed till she had ceased to know,
delight becomes pictorial
departed to the judgment,
did the harebell loose her girdle
distance is not the realm of fox,
doubt me, my dim companion!
down time’s quaint stream

drowning is not so pitiful
dust is the only secret,
each life converges to some centre
each that we lose takes part of us;
eden is that old-fashioned house
elijah’s wagon knew no thill,
elysium is as far as to
essential oils are wrung:
except the heaven had come so near,
except the smaller size, no lives are round,
except to heaven, she is nought;
exhilaration is the breeze
experiment to me
exultation is the going
faith is a fine invention
fame is a fickle food
far from love the heavenly father
farther in summer than the birds,
fate slew him, but he did not drop;
father, i bring thee not myself,—
few get enough,—enough is one;
finite to fail, but infinite to venture.
follow wise orion
for death,—or rather
for each ecstatic instant
forbidden fruit a flavor has
forever cherished be the tree,
frequently the woods are pink,
from all the jails the boys and girls
from cocoon forth a butterfly
from use she wandered now a year,
give little anguish
given in marriage unto thee,
glee! the great storm is over!
glory is that bright tragic thing,
glowing is her bonnet,
god gave a loaf to every bird,
god made a little gentian;
god permits industrious angels
going to heaven!
good night! which put the candle out?
great streets of silence led away
had this one day not been,
have you got a brook in your little heart,
he ate and drank the precious words,
he fumbles at your spirit
he preached upon “breadth” till it argued him narrow,—
he put the belt around my life,—
he touched me, so i live to know
heart not so heavy as mine,
heart, we will forget him!
heaven is what i cannot reach!
her final summer was it,
her grace is all she has,
her “last poems”—
high from the earth i heard a bird;
his bill an auger is,
his cheek is his biographer—
his mind, of man a secret makes,
hope is a subtle glutton;
hope is the thing with feathers
how dare the robins sing,
how destitute is he
how happy is the little stone
how many times these low feet staggered,
how still the bells in steeples stand.
how the old mountains drip with sunset,
i asked no other thing,
i bet with every wind that blew, till nature in chagrin
i breathed enough to learn the trick,
i bring an unaccustomed wine
i can wade grief,
i cannot live with you,
i can’t tell you, but you feel it—
i did not reach thee,
i died for beauty, but was scarce
i dreaded that first robin so,
i envy seas whereon he rides,
i felt a cleavage in my mind
i felt a funeral in my brain,
i fit for them,
i found the phrase to every thought
i gained it so,
i gave myself to him,
i had a daily bliss
i had a guinea golden;
i had been hungry all the years;
i had no cause to be awake,
i had no time to hate, because
i have a king who does not speak;
i have no life but this,
i have not told my garden yet,
i heard a fly buzz when i died;
i held a jewel in my fingers
i hide myself within my flower,
i know a place where summer strives
i know some lonely houses off the road
i know that he exists
i like a look of agony,
i like to see it lap the miles,
i live with him, i see his face;
i lived on dread; to those who know
i lost a world the other day.
i many times thought peace had come,
i meant to find her when i came;
i meant to have but modest needs,
i measure every grief i meet
i never hear the word “escape”
i never lost as much but twice,
i never saw a moor,
i never told the buried gold
i noticed people disappeared,
i read my sentence steadily,
i reason, earth is short,
i see thee better in the dark,
i send two sunsets—
i shall know why, when time is over,
i should have been too glad, i see,
i should not dare to leave my friend,
i showed her heights she never saw—
i sing to use the waiting,
i started early, took my dog,
i stepped from plank to plank
i taste a liquor never brewed,
i think just how my shape will rise
i think that the root of the wind is water,
i think the hemlock likes to stand
i took my power in my hand
i watched her face to see which way
i went to heaven,—
i went to thank her,
i wish i knew that woman’s name,
i wonder if the sepulchre
i worked for chaff, and earning wheat
i years had been from home,
i ’ll tell you how the sun rose,—
i ’m ceded, i ’ve stopped being theirs;
i ’m nobody! who are you?
i ’m thinking of that other morn,
i ’m wife; i ’ve finished that,
i ’ve got an arrow here;
i ’ve seen a dying eye
if anybody’s friend be dead,
if i can stop one heart from breaking,
if i could tell how glad i was,
if i may have it when it ’s dead
if i should die,
if i should n’t be alive
if pain for peace prepares,
if recollecting were forgetting,
if the foolish call them “flowers”,
if tolling bell i ask the cause.
if what we could were what we would—
if you were coming in the fall,
immortal is an ample word
immured in heaven! what a cell!
in lands i never saw, they say,
in winter, in my room,
is bliss, then, such abyss
is heaven a physician?
it can’t be summer,—that got through;
it dropped so low in my regard
it makes no difference abroad,
it might be easier
it sifts from leaden sieves,
it sounded as if the streets were running,
it struck me every day
it tossed and tossed,—
it was not death, for i stood up,
it was too late for man,
it ’s like the light,—
it ’s such a little thing to weep,
just lost when i was saved!
just so, jesus raps—he does not weary—
lay this laurel on the one
let down the bars, o death!
let me not mar that perfect dream
life, and death, and giants
lightly stepped a yellow star
like brooms of steel
like men and women shadows walk
like mighty footlights burned the red
like some old-fashioned miracle
like trains of cars on tracks of plush
look back on time with kindly eyes,
love is anterior to life,
love reckons by itself alone,
low at my problem bending,
march is the month of expectation,
me! come! my dazzled face
mine by the right of the white election!
mine enemy is growing old,—
morning is the place for dew,
morns like these we parted;
much madness is divinest sense
musicians wrestle everywhere:
my cocoon tightens, colors tease,
my country need not change her gown,
my friend must be a bird,
my life closed twice before its close;
my river runs to thee:
my wheel is in the dark,—
my worthiness is all my doubt,
nature is what we see,
nature rarer uses yellow
nature, the gentlest mother,
new feet within my garden go,
no autumn’s intercepting chill
no brigadier throughout the year
no matter where the saints abide,
no other can reduce
no rack can torture me,
no romance sold unto,
not any higher stands the grave
not any sunny tone
not in this world to see his face
not knowing when the dawn will come
not one by heaven defrauded stay,
not when we know
not with a club the heart is broken,
of all the souls that stand create
of all the sounds despatched abroad,
of bronze and blaze
of death the sharpest function,
of so divine a loss
of this is day composed—
of tribulation these are they
on my volcano grows the grass,—
on such a night, or such a night,
on the bleakness of my lot
on this long storm the rainbow rose,
on this wondrous sea,
one blessing had i, than the rest
one day is there of the series
one dignity delays for all,
one need not be a chamber to be haunted,
one of the ones that midas touched,
our journey had advanced;
our lives are swiss,—
our share of night to bear,
pain has an element of blank;
papa above!
perception of an
perhaps you’d like to buy a flower?
peril as a possession
pigmy seraphs gone astray,
pink, small, and punctual.
pompless no life can pass away;
poor little heart!
portraits are to daily faces
prayer is the little implement
presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
read, sweet, how others strove,
remembrance has a rear and front,—
remorse is memory awake,
reverse cannot befall that fine prosperity
safe despair it is that raves,
safe in their alabaster chambers,
she died at play,
she died,—this was the way she died;
she laid her docile crescent down,
she rose to his requirement, dropped
she slept beneath a tree
she sweeps with many-colored brooms,
she went as quiet as the dew
sleep is supposed to be,
so bashful when i spied her,
so gay a flower bereaved the mind
so proud she was to die
so set its sun in thee,
so, from the mould,
softened by time’s consummate plush,
some days retired from the rest
some keep the sabbath going to church;
some rainbow coming from the fair!
some things that fly there be,—
some, too fragile for winter winds,
soul, wilt thou toss again?
south winds jostle them,
speech is a symptom of affection,
split the lark and you ’ll find the music,
step lightly on this narrow spot!
success is counted sweetest
success is counted sweetest
summer begins to have the look,
summer for thee grant i may be
superfluous were the sun
superiority to fate
surgeons must be very careful
sweet hours have perished here;
sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
taken from men this morning,
talk with prudence to a beggar
that i did always love,
that is solemn we have ended,—
that love is all there is,
that she forgot me was the least,
that short, potential stir
that such have died enables us
the bat is dun with wrinkled wings
the bee is not afraid of me,
the bible is an antique volume
the blunder is to estimate,—
the body grows outside,—
the bone that has no marrow;
the brain is wider than the sky,
the brain within its groove
the bustle in a house
the butterfly obtains
the butterfly’s assumption-gown,
the clouds their backs together laid,
the cricket sang,
the daisy follows soft the sun,
the day came slow, till five o’clock,
the devil, had he fidelity,
the difference between despair
the distance that the dead have gone
the duties of the wind are few—
the dying need but little, dear,—
the face we choose to miss,
the farthest thunder that i heard
the feet of people walking home
the future never spoke,
the gentian weaves her fringes,
the gleam of an heroic act,
the grass so little has to do,—
the grave my little cottage is,
the healed heart shows its shallow scar
the heart asks pleasure first,
the hills erect their purple heads,
the incidents of love
the inundation of the spring
the largest fire ever known
the last night that she lived,
the leaves, like women, interchange
the long sigh of the frog
the look of thee, what is it like?
the luxury to apprehend
the missing all prevented me
the moon is distant from the sea,
the moon upon her fluent route
the moon was but a chin of gold
the morns are meeker than they were,
the mountain sat upon the plain
the murmur of a bee
the murmuring of bees has ceased;
the mushroom is the elf of plants,
the nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
the night was wide, and furnished scant
the one that could repeat the summer day
the ones that disappeared are back,
the only ghost i ever saw
the overtakelessness of those
the past is such a curious creature,
the pedigree of honey
the props assist the house
the rat is the concisest tenant.
the reticent volcano keeps
the right to perish might be thought
the robin is the one
the rose did caper on her cheek,
the sea said “come” to the brook,
the show is not the show,
the skies can’t keep their secret!
the sky is low, the clouds are mean,
the soul selects her own society,
the soul should always stand ajar.
the soul that has a guest,
the soul unto itself
the soul’s superior instants
the spider as an artist
the springtime’s pallid landscape
the stars are old, that stood for me—
the stimulus, beyond the grave
the suburbs of a secret
the sun just touched the morning;
the sun kept setting, setting still;
the sweets of pillage can be known
the thought beneath so slight a film
the treason of an accent
the way i read a letter’s this:
the wind begun to rock the grass
the wind tapped like a tired man,
the winds drew off
their height in heaven comforts not,
there came a day at summer’s full
there came a wind like a bugle;
there is a flower that bees prefer,
there is a shame of nobleness
there is a solitude of space,
there is a word
there is another loneliness
there is no frigate like a book
there ’s something quieter than sleep
there’s a certain slant of light,
there’s been a death in the opposite house
these are the days that reindeer love
these are the days when birds come back,
they dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
they say that “time assuages”,—
they won’t frown always—some sweet day
this is the land the sunset washes,
this merit hath the worst,—
this quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies,
this was in the white of the year,
this world is not conclusion;
those final creatures,—who they are—
though i get home how late, how late!
three weeks passed since i had seen her,—
through lane it lay, through bramble,
through the straight pass of suffering
tie the strings to my life, my lord,
title divine is mine
to be alive is power,
to fight aloud is very brave,
to hang our head ostensibly,
to hear an oriole sing
to help our bleaker parts
to know just how he suffered would be dear;
to learn the transport by the pain,
to lose one’s faith surpasses
to lose thee, sweeter than to gain
to love thee, year by year,
to make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,—
to my quick ear the leaves conferred;
to pile like thunder to its close,
to see her is a picture,
to tell the beauty would decrease,
to the staunch dust we safe commit thee;
to this apartment deep
to venerate the simple days
to-day or this noon
too cold is this
two butterflies went out at noon
two lengths has every day,
two swimmers wrestled on the spar
undue significance a starving man attaches
unto my books so good to turn
upon the gallows hung a wretch,
victory comes late,
volcanoes be in sicily
wait till the majesty of death
water is taught by thirst;
we cover thee, sweet face.
we learn in the retreating
we like march, his shoes are purple,
we never know how high we are
we never know we go,—when we are going
we outgrow love like other things
we play at paste,
we should not mind so small a flower,
we spy the forests and the hills,
we thirst at first,—’t is nature’s act;
went up a year this evening!
what if i say i shall not wait?
what inn is this
what mystery pervades a well!
what soft, cherubic creatures
when etna basks and purrs,
when i hoped i feared,
when i was small, a woman died.
when night is almost done,
when roses cease to bloom, dear,
where every bird is bold to go,
where ships of purple gently toss
whether my bark went down at sea,
while i was fearing it, it came,
who has not found the heaven below
who is it seeks my pillow nights?
who never lost, are unprepared
who never wanted,—maddest joy
who robbed the woods,
who were “the father and the son”—
wild nights! wild nights!
will there really be a morning?
witchcraft has not a pedigree,
within my reach!
you cannot put a fire out;
you left me, sweet, two legacies,—
you ’ve seen balloons set, haven’t you?
your riches taught me poverty.
’t is an honorable thought,
’t is little i could care for pearls
’t is so much joy! ’t is so much joy!
’t is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
’t is whiter than an indian pipe,
’t was a long parting, but the time
’t was comfort in her dying room
’t was just this time last year i died.
’t was later when the summer went
’t was such a little, little boat
“going to him! happy letter! tell him—
“heavenly father,” take to thee
“morning” means “milking” to the farmer
“remember me,” implored the thief—
“sown in dishonor?”
“whose are the little beds,” i asked,
