rosebud unfolding
close enough to touch
a jar of pennies
stone in my pocket
alzheimer's birthday
indian summer
among the gravestones
the wind of autumn
indian summer
meteor shower
lethal injection
morning overcast
late into the night
letting the branch go
winter seclusion
early morning sun
two women crying
chernobyl victim
silent cathedral
figure drawing class
phoning the neighbors
on the way to work
the one legged bird
walking in on her
circling each thigh
in utter stillness
out of its slipper
my father's hammer
under trees and sky
under the back steps
early april rain
the grey cranes at dusk
checking for water
fields of corn stretching
crossing the bright sky
where the ripple was
never expecting
the way of the conch
reaching into sky
my third glass of wine
philosophy class
stirring my coffee
their first thanksgiving
graduation day
our pilot hopes
candlelight dinner
crossing the hopscotch
as if it were spring
independence day
my father and i
rodeo cowboy
grocery shopping
grinding sausage meat
getting acquainted
after lovemaking
in the midway sun
a lull in her hands
identical twins
at the flea market
carrying their canes
driving lesson done
his ashes scattered
letting the dog out
overmatched boxer
too quick to reply
antiquities room
meeting her boyfriend
from the holy land
hole in the ozone
how desirable
in his mothers house
independence day
fathers funeral
january thaw
the petals scatter
over the earths edge
amish gentleman's
music on the wind
new year's eve blizzard
the evening paper
quiet afternoon
the frozen puddle
elderly couple
on razor wire
my silver shackles
butterfly shadows 
the river wind blows
on the riverfront
in the morning shops
in a pecan grove
parked on the runway
gathering silence
against the wind's chill
on the cardboard box
wind chill minus five
between lace curtains
in the shadow of
last nights fading dream 
april sun slanting
little ladybug
starting a new month
chilly june morning
sixty day jail term
summer afternoon
through two marriages
juice from the apple
the sound of scissors
paddling slowly
the old garden fence
hot rock by the stream
caressed by sea air
alone this winter
american dream
once before you go
a red maple leaf
stargazer lilies
indian paintbrush
retirement home
after the air show
a sliver of clay
fading harbour light
the wad of paper
more news of the war
a whitetail flickers
summer afternoon
into his trousers
three days of downpour
dreaming in the flames
remembering dad
relaxing my arm
autumn butterfly
today the tulips
opening slowly
frost at the window
the carousel spins
my delighted dog
months after chemo
image of the moon
end of october
walking in the woods
forgotten garden
deepening twilight
family chapel
after the concert
retirement day
and so i agree
higher than the roof
second miscarriage
after the dentist
passing the cream puffs
hiroshima day
valentine's morning
family secrets
a rack of antlers
gone to bed angry
honeymoon dinner
indian summer
evoking clusters
uncle's trophy wife
second heart attack
summer veranda
cleaning everything
flight out of vegas
almost visible
the new employee
after lovemaking
family meeting
early morning fog
nursing home front porch
measuring the curves
not until the fog
at dusk a small witch
fifty years later
just as in childhood
blank windows next door
meeting an old friend
darkening the shade
the war off again
estuary mud
winter solitude
high above the clouds
above the flood plain
coal miner's cortege
how still the morning
naming the boulders
sheep in the churchyard
among the splashes
losing the dispute
mist shrouded river
another new moon
death day of my son
visiting her grave
autumn afternoon
each time the train stops
my third glass of wine
philosophy class
stirring my coffee
their first thanksgiving
graduation day
our pilot hopes
candlelight dinner
crossing the hopscotch
as if it were spring
independence day
my father and i
rodeo cowboy
grocery shopping
grinding sausage meat
getting acquainted
after lovemaking
late february
in the midway sun
a lull in her hands
identical twins
at the flea market
carrying their canes
driving lesson done
his ashes scattered
letting the dog out
overmatched boxer
too quick to reply
antiquities room
meeting her boyfriend
from the holy land
hole in the ozone
how desirable
in his mother's house
rosebud unfolding
close enough to touch
a jar of pennies
stone in my pocket
alzheimer's birthday
indian summer
among the gravestones
the wind of autumn
indian summer

early april rain
the grey cranes at dusk
checking for water
fields of corn stretching
crossing the bright sky
where the ripple was
never expecting
the way of the conch
reaching into sky
after the sunset
mouth of the river
flashes of lightning
the faint melody
on the piano
island morning fog
where the maple stood
november sunset
stooping on the edge
birdsong before dawn
asylum window
overgrown thicket
blowing through the holes
always a few steps
left out overnight
lovers looking up
november darkness
carrying sunlight
a calf born today
formation of geese
opening the door
so few feathers left
square little windows
family secrets
orion rising
winter solitude
simmering rhubarb
bush cemetery
day after christmas
retirement home
fishing before dawn
summer afternoon
among the headstones
rowing me upstream
it could be nothing
holly trees surround
sketching the sapling
in an open jar
traveling the creek
expectant father
midwinter sermon
sugar moon rising
church memorial
open cellar door
first sun barely up
sharing a silence
drinking iced coffee
first sun of the year
through the bay window
under the table
restless autumn sea
making bean soup for
reaching summer's end
rising harvest moon
spattered and faded
year of the dragon
with lengthening days
the familiar cough
munitions worker
finding her letter
early morning light
the billowing cloud
on a dark highway
winter solitude
sweeping up new year's
snuffing out candles
new year's confetti
galloping a horse
