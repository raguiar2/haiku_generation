Poems are seven lines each, delimited by the line breaks

after lovemaking
robs millionth defect alarmed
fated attacker

letting the branch go
conjuror conjuror yelp
chimneys hem breakfast

flight out of vegas
reminiscence wires francs
quince psychic dwelt knew

above the flood plain
connoisseur connoisseur spreads
sighed vase dove otter's

rodeo cowboy
sometime sometime noblest dwelt
footsteps settles snails
