flowing estuary
close enough to touch
family reunion
a jar of pennies
stone in my pocket
alzheimer's birthday
the page-finders
summer evening
the wind of autumn
lethal injection
geronimo's grave
morning overcast
autumn evening . . .
autumn evening
late into the night
riveredge old growth:
the beetle i righted
letting the branch go
winter seclusion
after the stroke. . .
early morning sun
the war memorial
sunlight shines red
chernobyl victim
ninety winters
silent cathedral
first days of summer . . .
watermelon rind,
figure drawing class
abandoned store
phoning the neighbors
old woman, wrapping
on the way to work
the one legged bird
walking in on her
in utter stillness
out of its slipper
my father's hammer
under trees and sky
autumn afternoon:
ten below zero:
under the back steps
early april rain
blackened walnut
distant woodchopper
checking for water
the path shorter now,
fields of corn stretching
crossing the bright sky
never expecting
the way of the conch
reaching into sky
my third glass of wine
philosophy class
stirring my coffee
their first thanksgiving
engagement ring
our pilot hopes
candlelight dinner
crossing the hopscotch
as if it were spring
independence day
my father and i
grocery shopping
conservatory,
grinding sausage meat
getting acquainted
werewolf movie
in the midway sun
valentines day
a lull in her hands
family reunion
identical twins
at the flea market
carrying their canes
driving lesson done
reconciliation
letting the dog out
too quick to reply
in a semi circle
antiquities room
meeting her boyfriend
from the holy land
the words unspoken . . .
hole in the ozone
in his mothers house
independence day
summer evening
fathers funeral
the petals scatter
a single leaf falling
over the earths edge
amish gentleman's
music on the wind
new year's eve blizzard
by the lawn's edge,
my silver shackles
butterfly shadows 
the river wind blows
on the riverfront
in the morning shops
in a pecan grove
gathering silence
against the wind's chill
(the girl with the soul
on the cardboard box
from the fire escape
new condominium
wind chill minus five
between lace curtains
in the shadow of
last nights fading dream 
under cloudless skies;
april sun slanting
starting a new month
chilly june morning
sixty day jail term
summer afternoon
through two marriages
a horse-drawn plow:
the sound of scissors
that sonofabitch
the old garden fence
hot rock by the stream
delivery room--
snow in the treetops--
first autumn colour--
solar eclipse...
alone this winter
grapefruit harvest
american dream
once before you go
stargazer lilies
night comes early
retirement home
cattails in moonlight
after the air show
long spring evening:
a sliver of clay
fading harbour light
the wad of paper
more news of the war
valentine's day
summer afternoon
into his trousers
moon at our window
three days of downpour
path of pine needles...
remembering dad
relaxing my arm
trying to call it off
the clackity-clack
autumn evening
our arguement lasts
autumn butterfly
cold and overcast...
today the tulips
opening slowly
frost at the window
the carousel spins
my delighted dog
months after chemo
rain, song in a field
image of the moon
end of october
walking in the woods
forgotten garden
deepening twilight
family chapel
the old mare's grave
after the concert
retirement day
and so i agree
higher than the roof
second miscarriage
after the dentist
passing the cream puffs
hiroshima day
family secrets
a rack of antlers
gone to bed angry
spading the garden
honeymoon dinner
his cluttered house
carrying a pencil
evoking clusters
uncle's trophy wife
trees thick with leaves
open-air t'ai chi
second heart attack
summer veranda
the rabbi rides
flight out of vegas
family meeting
early morning fog
the winter sun...low,
nursing home front porch
the visible edges
pachelbel's canon
not until the fog
at dusk a small witch
after-lunch siesta
fifty years later
just as in childhood
the curandera
blank windows next door
wearing dark glasses,
meeting an old friend
well-dressed matron
the bell-ringers pause
darkening the shade
the moons apostrophe
the war off again
the cries of lapwings
winter solitude
cumulonimbus
high above the clouds
above the flood plain
coal miner's cortege
how still the morning
naming the boulders
sheep in the churchyard
among the splashes
losing the dispute
mist shrouded river
another new moon
notice of your death...
death day of my son
visiting her grave
autumn afternoon
each time the train stops
my third glass of wine
philosophy class
stirring my coffee
graveside service
their first thanksgiving
engagement ring
our pilot hopes
candlelight dinner
crossing the hopscotch
as if it were spring
independence day
my father and i
grocery shopping
conservatory,
grinding sausage meat
getting acquainted
werewolf movie
birthmark removed
in the midway sun
valentine's day
a lull in her hands
family reunion
identical twins
at the flea market
carrying their canes
driving lesson done
reconciliation
letting the dog out
too quick to reply
in a semi circle
antiquities room
meeting her boyfriend
from the holy land
the words unspoken...
hole in the ozone
in his mother's house
flowing estuary
close enough to touch
family reunion
a jar of pennies
stone in my pocket
alzheimer's birthday
the page-finders
summer evening
the wind of autumn
lethal injection

the snow-spinning wind
after the sunset
mouth of the river
flashes of lightning
the faint melody
wind in tamaracks
island morning fog
november sunset
stooping on the edge
birdsong before dawn
asylum window
something adrift
her texted outrage
receding thunder...
plum blossoms falling...
overgrown thicket
the stone cutter's yard
back-to-back blizzards
old cemetary
always a few steps
left out overnight
winter evening
carrying the harvest
a buzzing bumble bee
lovers looking up
november darkness
enamelled top
a calf born today
sauteed fiddleheads
formation of geese
opening the door
so few feathers left
drive-in movie
a sudden tinkling
family secrets
the piano hammers
winter solitude
simmering rhubarb
bush cemetery
day after christmas
retirement home
fishing before dawn
summer afternoon
rowing me upstream
filtered sunlight
it could be nothing
holly trees surround
sketching the sapling
frost-tipped blossoms
acacia seeds rattle
in an open jar
traveling the creek
expectant father
crows on phone lines
midwinter sermon
jar of tadpoles
family reunion
sugar moon rising
open cellar door
from the bare hilltop,
sharing a silence
decades in l.a.
first sun of the year
through the bay window
restless autumn sea
your share of our life
making bean soup for
reaching summer's end
rising harvest moon
year of the dragon
an eighth grader's voice
with lengthening days
the familiar cough
munitions worker
persimmon fabric
finding her letter
early morning light
the billowing cloud
on a dark highway
jet contrail blending
winter solitude
sweeping up new year's
snuffing out candles
we wade our way in
fallen persimmon
new year's confetti
galloping a horse
