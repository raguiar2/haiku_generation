wariest of the first
published by a man who had
been so that he
was not to be found in
his own and i have no
more than all things which is

immutably fulfilling jawbone expands

from their hearts but
for ever as if thou art
my heart with me here where

bovem showd rotting sleep again ye

paperwork redecked asopus swallowed up its
way through many years ago twas
then let us go forth into
one day after long before him
