Poems are seven lines each, delimited by the line breaks

rowing in the sun
goes down to be a little
heart i could not
so much joy t is all
we are you know it was
such an hour of me how
many times when they have been

fleshly gate bereaved acknowledgment
pods redecked its own perusal ranks
Coach jewel Sits vane
Marble Afforded kinds earthly sum pantomime
himself inform volumes shake your deathless
tree and then he never saw
before my soul that which from

treasures boot importuned Afterwardsday
boon sunrise once entirely for her
face his best expositor
trailing courtesy will tell him just
as if any time had come
back on this way she died
but one by day long parting
