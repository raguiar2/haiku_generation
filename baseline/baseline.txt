Poems are seven lines each, delimited by the line breaks

harvests redecked volumes pods
vane Sits ranks importuned bereaved to
know it in her
bonnet but this little maid t
were they are done expecting me
and of a day with you
could see his countenance kinds jewel

Suffocate stirring Coach Afterwardsday
Marble trailing courtesy pantomime sunrise Afforded
boon mutual Dispelled Finitude
Britain earthly sum boot Peru record
thee better than our minds recede
daffodil other side the door should
build as soon assault dearth Gold

Grandfather whether Consumes made
reply platoon volume Partaken Alps Hadnt
owl preferment Dwell Upon
Regards Balm brush maize owe wilderness
Assent surge emperor boggy entirely belt
getting gurgle rare poets ended abstinence
own carries universe no less though
